THINGS TO DO:

SUN level.
CREDITS level.

Multiple endings?
  Problems:
    need to load 2 seperate levels, instead of jsut 1.
      could be combatted by using same / similar audio...
    Could just make it 1 Level w/ multiple if statments defining direction of movement etc.

    Going inside egg will lead to egg being global ?

Actual ending?

Better way of doing transitions / text chunks
how to make 1level place based on position of last level ( AKA sparkles is moving camera );
