TODO:

- Figure best way to update loaded audio textures
// - Need a global 3D Mouse position, which also means a global Intersect plane!
- every page should have text on it ( could be blank for transition pages? );
- G.camera.tweenToLookAt function
- Global Mani Charcter!!
  - Global Mani Character should have a 'localPosition' , which is updated every frame  
    and gives a position that is in the space of the specific page!
  - Need to make a way for mani to be able to 'jump' so we don't need to worry about max speed for physics renderer
    - Gets the difference between leader and jump pos,
    - Adds to each of data texture
    - sets dT equal to 0 for a moment
    - calls update, to kill extra velocity

- Clean up shaders for Forest!

- Looper bug when moved away
